                  weeded out the Top Ten Tips for healthy, happy plants.
               </h6>
               <h5>1.​ ​Choose Plants Based on Light in your Space</h5>
               <p>Are the plants you love the ones you can have? The​ available light in your space will help you
                  decide. Check the direction your windows are facing; south-facing windows give bright light,
                  east/west-facing windows give moderate light and north-facing windows give low light. Most
                  houseplants
                  prefer bright, indirect sunlight.
               </p>
               <p>If the sun is intense through your windows, add a lovely sheer curtain to diffuse the light. Cacti
                  and
                  some succulents like aloe can of course handle brighter, direct sunlight. You don’t want to
                  overexpose
                  or underexpose any plant. They need the right amount of light to live.
               </p>
               <h5>2.​ Figure Out Your Plant Compatibility</h5>
               <p>New to plant parenthood? A
                  busy
                  work schedule, social​ ​life and general forgetfulness can lead to unintentional plant neglect.
                  It’s
                  okay. Some plants can handle that kind of lifestyle. A jetsetter like yourself will enjoy the
                  resilience
                  of low-maintenance succulents, ZZ plants or snake plants, all pretty low
                  key,
                  as long as they have enough light (bright and low light respectively). These should keep looking
                  their
                  best when you return from your next trip.
               </p>
               <p>If you’ve got more time, you can try a few attention-loving air plants, orchids or ferns. Like a mist for the face, an
                  extra spritz of filtered water daily between waterings keeps humidity levels nice and balanced for
                  these
                  delicate plants.
               </p>
               <h5>3.​ ​Less (Water) Is More</h5>
               <p>It’s better to under water your
                  plants
                  than to overwater. Too much water can lead to root rot. Ditch your water schedule and water your
                  plant
                  only when it needs it. Check the soil first to make sure it’s dry at least 2 inches deep below the
                  surface. If your soil looks dark in color, feels moist, and sticks to your finger, your plant has
                  enough
                  water to do it’s thing for now.
               </p>
               <p>How often you water will also change throughout the year. Plants need less water in the winter, when they’re
                  growing
                  slower, the days are shorter and sunlight is less intense. If the heat is on and the soil is drying
                  quicker, they may need a bit more water. Wilting leaves or soil that looks pulled away from the
                  sides of
                  the planter are signs of a thirsty plant.
               </p>
               <p>Always use warm water because it absorbs best. Pour water directly on the soil around the base of the
                  plant, because plants absorb water from their roots. The only exception here is Epiphytes, like air
                  plants, who need water on their leaves as well.
               </p>
               <p>Place a saucer under your planter. When you water, let it soak in for a few hours, then toss any
                  water
                  that’s left on the saucer. If no water is left over, give the soil another soak.
               </p>
               <h5>4.​ ​Raise the Humidity Levels</h5>
               <p>Staying true to your plants
                  natural environment will help your plant thrive indoors. Most tropical plants, ferns and
                  orchids
                  prefer high humidity and bright to moderate, indirect light. Mist these plants in between waterings
                  with
                  filtered water. During the dry months of winter, grouping similar plants together helps to create a
                  more
                  humid microclimate. A humidifier can help too and it’s great for humans. On the other hand, most
                  desert
                  dwellers, like cacti, prefer dry air and bright, direct light with no shade at all. They definitely
                  don’t need to be misted and don’t care for humidity all that much.
               </p>
               <h5>5.​ ​A Note on Stability</h5>
               <p>Keep​ ​your​ ​plant’s​ ​home environment as stable as possible. Extreme changes can stress plants
                  out.
                  Keep the temperature between 65 and 75 degrees F. Avoid placing your plants near radiators, A/C
                  units
                  and forced-air vents, which can create hot or cold drafts.
               </p>
               <h5>6.​ ​Skip The Fertilizer</h5>
               <p>It’s fine ​​​to​ ​skip the 
                  fertilizer.
                  Too
                  much fertilizer can do more harm than good. Houseplants tend to not need fertilizer as often as
                  outdoor
                  plants do. If you do choose to fertilize your plant, it’s best to do so during the growing season
                  (early
                  spring to early fall) and follow the general rule of thumb: ‘less is more’. Most store-​bought
                  fertilizers should be diluted with water before use.
               </p>
               <p>If you have had your plant for at least year, you can fertilize it for the first time. We suggest
                  using
                  an all-purpose fertilizer. Always follow the instructions. If you’ve just changed the soil, skip the
                  fertilizer. Fresh soil has enough new nutrients.
               </p>
               <h5>7.​ ​Find A Reliable Dealer</h5>
               <p>Purchase​ ​your ​plants ​from​ ​a​ ​reputable​ ​source like The Sill! Stick with local nurseries,
                  your
                  local garden center, and specialty stores or florists. Purchasing from a source with plant experts
                  on-site means they can answer all your questions. Most people who sell or work with plants love
                  talking
                  about them. We definitely do.
               </p>
               <p>Avoid large department stores and supermarkets where plants are usually stored in basements or dark
                  warehouses. Check your plant
                  out for yellow leaves, powdery mildew, strange spots, brown tips and weak stems as these are
                  signs of an unhealthy plant. Go for green.
               </p>
               <h5>8.​ Show A Little TLC</h5>
               <p>Friendships are fragile. You and your plant need time to adjust co-existing. Show your plant a little
                  extra attention starting out. Observing your plant will tell you when to water and when to not, if
                  the
                  temperature is too high or too low, and if it’s getting enough sun. Plus they’re so pleasing to look
                  at.
               </p>
               <h5>9.​ ​Don’t Be Scared to Repot</h5>
               <p>A common misconception – repotting does
                  not
                  necessarily mean putting your plant in a new planter, but rather, changing out your plant’s soil
                  with fresh potting mix. New plants
                  should
                  be repotted at some point and given fresh soil, as they are not meant to live in the plastic
                  containers
                  that they are usually sold in, and are often overgrown, plus a new planter could really tie the room
                  together. Choose a planter only 1 to 3 inches larger than its current container. The idea is that
                  your
                  plant is not swimming in soil, which may lead you to overwater. Keep it tight.
               </p>
               <h5>10.​ ​Let it Flow</h5>
               <p>When you move your plant to a new, larger planter,
                  whether it’s terra cotta, ceramic, or fiber glass, make sure it has drainage, a fancy word for “hole
                  at
                  the bottom”. This will prevent overwatering as any excess water will have a place to flow. Get a
                  saucer
                  or tray and place it underneath to avoid a wet floor or window sill.
               </p>
               <p>You can get DIY and make your own drainage by lining the bottom of your planter with rocks to create
                  crevices for the water to drain into. Here at The Sill, we use lava rocks because they’re
                  porous.
